--- Old ideas from before I even started really working on the program
Two possible methods of encoding
	Reserving 0-bytes as terminators and using only values 1 to 255 to encode numeric values
		would allow for binary searches
	Preceding all numeric values with a byte specifying the length in bytes of the number

Having a number specifying distance to next entry?
